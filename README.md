# ec-helper

---

The **ec-helper** Go package is designed to simplify the management of both `ECDSA` and `ECDH` operations. This package requires only the generation of an ECDSA key and provides key management that can be used for both `ECDSA` and `ECDH` operations. Additionally, it supports converting these keys to `PEM` format and loading keys from `PEM` format.
